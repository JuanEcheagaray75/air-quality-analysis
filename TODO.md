# TODO

- [ ] Add pictures of the development team in the ABOUT page, maybe a small description of who we are accompanied by some contact information
- [ ] Add a map to the HOME tab with a summary of the worst contaminant per station. Need to get precise coordinates for all the stations
- [ ] Add another tab talking about data quality?
- [ ] Add a link to the github repo in the ABOUT tab
